# ‚úß‡º∫ Becoming Constellations ‡ºª‚úß

> *"The true picture of the past flits by. The past can be seized only as an image which flashes up at the instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again."* ‚Äî Walter Benjamin

## ‚ü° Welcome to the Constellation ‚ü°

**Becoming Constellations** is a transdisciplinary knowledge garden exploring the intersections of time, dialectics, regenerative practice, and spiritual traditions. Drawing primarily on Walter Benjamin's philosophy and Hegelian dialectics, this project seeks to construct "constellations" of meaning across disparate domains of knowledge and practice.

The central thesis is that authentic transformation ("becoming") requires the dialectical negation of what currently "is" (being), creating momentary alignments (constellations) where past, present, and future illuminate each other in what Benjamin terms "monadic" moments.
