# ✧༺ Becoming Constellations ༻✧

> *"The true picture of the past flits by. The past can be seized only as an image which flashes up at the instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again."* — Walter Benjamin

A transdisciplinary knowledge garden exploring the intersections of time, dialectics, regenerative practice, and spiritual traditions.

## 🌟 Overview

**Becoming Constellations** is a public knowledge repository that integrates Walter Benjamin's philosophy, Hegelian dialectics, and mystical traditions into a coherent framework for understanding and practicing regenerative transformation. The project creates "constellations" of meaning across disparate domains of knowledge and practice.
