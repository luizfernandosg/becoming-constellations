# Contributing to Becoming Constellations

> *"In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it."* ‚Äî Walter Benjamin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Becoming Constellations knowledge garden! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively while maintaining the project's philosophical integrity and community orientation.

## üåü Contribution Philosophy

### Dialectical Methodology
All contributions should embody dialectical thinking:
- **Preserve** valuable elements from existing work
- **Negate** limitations and contradictions  
- **Transcend** through creative synthesis
- **Avoid** false unity that papers over real tensions

### Community Orientation
Consider how your contribution serves:
- Collective learning and development
- Practical application in community work
- Cross-cultural dialogue and synthesis
- Regenerative transformation and healing

### Quality Standards
- **Theoretical Grounding** - Connect to philosophical framework
- **Practical Relevance** - Include concrete applications
- **Cultural Sensitivity** - Respect diverse wisdom traditions
- **Accessibility** - Write for broad community engagement

## üìù Types of Contributions

### üîó Connection Building
**What it is:** Creating links, cross-references, and constellation patterns between different content areas
